1. Create a folder named "assets" in your project directory
2. Add your logo image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG) to the assets folder
3. Name it "logo.png" (or update the src path in demo.html)
4. Recommended logo specifications:
   - Size: 40x40 pixels (will scale automatically)
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred)
   - Style: Should match your blue/orange theme
